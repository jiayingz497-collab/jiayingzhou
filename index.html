        <p>Jiaying Zhou began studying the violin at the age of three, inspired by the sweet and delicate sounds she first heard on television. What began as a childhood fascination soon grew into a lifelong pursuit, sustained by twenty years of systematic training and study. Over time, she developed not only technical mastery but also a deep artistic connection with the instrument.</p>

        <p>Her musical journey has been defined by rich orchestral experiences. As principal second violinist of the Ningbo Student Symphony Orchestra in her junior high years and later as concertmaster of the UIC Orchestra during her undergraduate studies, she learned the discipline, leadership, and collaborative spirit required of an orchestral musician. In 2023, under the guidance of Professor Yi Yang, assistant conductor of the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra, she performed in multiple orchestral projects, including a solo feature of Schindler’s List with the UIC Orchestra. This experience, warmly received by audiences, strengthened her commitment to pursuing a professional orchestral career.</p>

        <p>These orchestral experiences also prepared Jiaying for further leadership in chamber music. At the Zephyr Chamber Music Festival in Italy in 2024, she collaborated in four concerts within one week. Performing alongside international colleagues taught her the importance of flexibility, communication, and shared artistry, lessons that continue to enrich her orchestral playing today.</p>

        <p>Besides musical performance, Jiaying is also skilled in film music, algorithmic music, and recording production. She adeptly integrates these techniques with music, broadening her artistic horizons and keeping pace with contemporary music trends.</p>

        <p>Jiaying is currently pursuing her master’s degree in violin performance at the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University, where she studies with Taiwanese violinist Professor Keng-Yuan Tseng. Building on her extensive orchestral and chamber music foundation, she is steadily advancing toward her goal of becoming a professional orchestral violinist.</p>
